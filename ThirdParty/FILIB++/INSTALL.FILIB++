**********************************************************************

If you are working under Unix/Linux-like system and you have `wget'
installed, you can download the required source code for FILIB++
by executing the included script `get.FILIB++' in this directory.

Otherwise, follow those instructions:

FILIB++ is available at

http://www.math.uni-wuppertal.de/wrswt/software/filib++/filib++-dist.tar.gz

Please download the 'filib++-dist.tar.gz' tarball and unpack it in this directory.

tar xzf filib++-dist.tar.gz

As next step it is required to apply a set of patches

patch -p0 < filib.patch
patch -p0 < filib.patch2
patch -p0 < filib.patch3
patch -p0 < filib.patch4
patch -p0 < filib.patch5

and to copy some files required by the build system into the filib distribution:

cp interval_Makefile.am interval/Makefile.am
cp interval_Makefile.in interval/Makefile.in

If you then run the configure script, it would automatically detect the 
sources and prepare the Makefiles so that they will be automaticall compiled.
