Welcome to LaGO.

For installation instructions and required third party packages see INSTALL.

**** Overview:
Next to this README file, you'll find the following in your LaGO distribution:

AUTHORS    - who's writing on LaGO

INSTALL	   - installation instructions

LICENCE    - Common Public Licence 1.0

ThirdParty - a directory for third party packages needed by LaGO, including also scripts to download them (cf. INSTALL).

src        - LaGO source code, also build-directory, and finally directory of LaGO binary

mod        - a few MINLP examples from GAMS/MINLPLib, translated to AMPL format and compiled to .nl format

doc        - a small documentation


**** Usage:
LaGO can be accessed via AMPL. For that, compile an AMPL file to create the appropriate .nl file. Give the name of this file as first argument to AMPL. Additionally, you can give a LAGO-optionfile as second argument.
usage: LaGO <AMPL-nl-file> [<optionfile>]
example (assuming that you are in src): LaGO ../mod/alan


**** Documentation:
The directory doc contains a makefile which calls doxygen to generate a LaGO-class description and a parameter documentation.
The easiest is to call make in the doc directory. Then point your webbrower to the file doc/html/index.html in your LaGO distribution.
In the footer of this webpage you'll find the parameter documentation.

A small overview over the LaGO Branch and Cut algorithm and some proposals for an integration of LaGO into COIN-OR can be found in COINintegration.tex in doc.
A recent paper describing the Branch and Cut algorithm implemented in LaGO can be found at http://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/publ/pre/2006/P-06-24.ps
