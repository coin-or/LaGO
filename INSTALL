Short installation instructions for LaGO

**** Requirements:
LaGO depends on several third party packages, from whom some are optional.
The ThirdParty directory contains some scripts to download and compile some of these packages.

1. The Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT) from NIST
http://math.nist.gov/tnt
Use the script get.TNT in ThirdParty.

2. RANLIB.C - Random Number Generation
http://www.netlib.org/random/ranlib.c.tar.gz
Use the script get.ranlib in ThirdParty.

3. METIS - Serial Graph Partitioning and Fill-reducing Matrix Ordering
http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview
Use the script get.METIS in ThirdParty.

4. AMPL interface (ASL)
http://www.netlib.org/ampl/
Use the script get.ASL in ThirdParty.

5. COIN-OR components: Osi, Clp, Cgl, Ipopt
http://www.coin-or.org
Currently there is no tool to download and install these components.
Please get your own COIN-distribution and compile the packages Cgl, Clp, Osi, OsiClp, CoinUtils, and Ipopt.
Then point the COINDIR variable in src/makefile to your location of COIN.
The makefile assumes to find the libraries at $COINDIR/lib and the include files at $COINDIR/include.

6. optional: Interval arithmetic library FILIB++
You can get it from http://www.math.uni-wuppertal.de/wrswt/software/filib.html.
But the installation seem to be a bit tricky. Details will be added later.

7. optional: SNOPT
If you have a SNOPT distribution, uncomment the corresponding lines in src/makefile and set the SNOPTDIR variable to the place of your SNOPT library (libsnopt.a).


**** Compilation of LaGO:
After installation of the required third party packages, go to the directory src.
There you find a makefile, which is still quite manageable. Please adjust it to your system.
Then call make. This should compile and link a binary called LaGO.
